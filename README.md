restheart-python-test
=====================

A set of integration tests showing how to interact with RESTHeart's API via Python.
It's more ore less the Python version of the [API Tutorial](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/x/GICM)

You must start MongoDB +  RESTHeart before, and the easiest way is to use either [Vagrant boxes for RESTHeart](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-vagrant) or [Docker containers for RESTHeart](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-docker).
